# Italian Healthcare Ontology & RDF Dataset

Ontology modeling, CSV â†’ RDF mapping (YARRRML/RML), and DCAT-AP_IT metadata for an interoperable healthcare dataset of inpatient facilities in Italy.

Course context: Metodi informatici per la trasformazione digitale (AA 2024â€“2025, University of Bologna).

I acted as Project Manager (PM) for the course backlog and Product Owner (PO) for this project. This deliverable was conceived, implemented, and documented entirely by me (ontology, CSV curation, YARRRML/RML mapping and execution, DCAT-AP_IT metadata, and repository documentation). We were a 4-person team for the course, but my teammates focused on other projects, while I completed this one end-to-end. I tracked the overall backlog in Taiga.
